# itkComposeVectorImageFilter

An [ITK](http://www.itk.org/) filter to combine several vector images into a new vector image.

This filter is highly inspired by the [itk::ComposeImageFilter](http://www.itk.org/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1ComposeImageFilter.html).

Note: this filter has been written for ITK 4.4 and has not been updated since.
